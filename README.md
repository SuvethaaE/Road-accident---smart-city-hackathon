# Road accident - smart city hackathon
 
India loses 1.2 lakh lives due to road accidents every year. The main reason behind this is lack of awareness about the accident in most of the location in India. So, basically the idea of ROAD ACCIDENT SAFETY AWARENESS SYSTEM is to help the people to get awareness based on the location they travel. Our team decided to develop a working model or a prototype where the user i.e., people can login to our website and give the necessary input. A person can give LOCATION for example, Andhra Pradesh, Assam, YEAR for example 2020 to 2021, WEATHER CONDITION for example mist/fog, snow, cloudy and as an output they will receive a graph which will give information about total number of accidents, number of people injured and number of people killed in that particular location. Graph displaying the weather conditions and graph dispalying the road conditions.People also will receive a predicted message as an output giving awareness whether is it safe to travel in that particular location. For prediction and data visualization we have chosen a dataset with which we will predict the output using ML based technology. Also, we will try to implement extra features i.e., calling ambulance, calling police.We will also try to expand our project including sensors.
we have displayed Bar Graph and Line plot for vizualising Number of people killed and Number of people injured in different scenario : 1)zone wise 2) weather conditions 3)Road condition
